I bought most of my cameras on flea markets and in junk shops. And sometimes they either have still a fit in them or are in a bag or box which also contains some negatives or slides. There can be other things in there as well like filters, manuals or other equipment.

Sometimes I got those process and digitized, those are part of these categories:

* [Found File](/tags/Found-Film)
* [Found Negative](/tags/Found-Negative)
